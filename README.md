## Abstract

Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is a growing global health concern that threatens the future of human wellbeing. The leading causes of increased ABR—excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics—can be linked to a diverse array of multidisciplinary environmental factors, largely those related to the healthcare, agricultural, and food industries. Here, we employ machine learning to understand antibiotic resistance trends, utilizing a dataset of 804 socioeconomic, environmental, and demographic indicators to identify the most effective predictors of and factors contributing to ABR, and predict antibiotic resistance for years with available data using the model. We predicted that machine learning would be able to accurately predict antibiotic resistance and that the significant predictors would be diverse, though primarily environmental-related. We found that global antibiotic use and resistance risk has predictables trends by means of machine learning, with our models’ accuracy being above 95%. We also found that the best predictors of ABR were most often environmental factors. Nonetheless, the significance of a diverse array of factors indicates that antibiotic use and resistance is an inherently multidisciplinary issue. Overall, our study can be used to inform policymakers across all disciplines to implement measures to mitigate the rise of antibiotic resistance.

## Results

We achieved a 97.74% accuracy in predicting the category of training data [(Fig. 1)](https://thataquarel.github.io/health/), and a 95.17% accuracy in predicting the category of testing data [(Fig. 2)](https://thataquarel.github.io/health/), allowing the model to confidently discern between the five categories in total antibiotic usage. We were therefore convinced in applying the model to make future predictions [(Fig. 3)](https://thataquarel.github.io/health/) and to obtain the most effective predictors of high antibiotic usage.
